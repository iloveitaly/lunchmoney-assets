## Write Or Update Readme

Write or update the @README.md:

* First, think hard and investigate the source code in the repository to understand what it does
* If the readme already exists, do not reword sections which feel complete or whose functionality has not changed.
  * However, if specific rules below conflict with what is written, follow the rules below
* Be concise, do not use too many adjectives
* The title should be a short description of the project, not just the project name
* Don't try to be too cute: no story telling and do not be overly salesly.
* No emojis
* Assume `uv` and omit pip examples
* Include a single line at the end `# [MIT License](LICENSE.md)`
* When writing the overview and `#` header, be sure to:
  * Think of what keywords another developer might search for.
  * Include the primary goal of the project or primary problem solved in a short paragraph.
    * If you aren't sure what the primary goal of the project is, ask.
    * For the title, don't include just the name of the package. Instead make it a short description of the project. Just a handful of words, such as 'Manage Python Project
      Dependencies'
* After a general overview, include the following sections: Installation, Usage, Features.
  * When writing out a list of features, use a bullet list.
* Do not include every usage example varaint for a CLI or library. The goal is to give an overview so the user can figure out the rest on their own.

Here's the writing style you should use:

> Conversational and personal, often in first-person with enthusiastic, reflective tone on tech, startups, and health topics. Logical structure: hooks, breakdowns via subsections/lists, and practical steps. Vocabulary mixes everyday terms with technical jargon (e.g., tmux, Caddy, REPL). Short-to-medium sentences for clarity; semi-formal with casual asides and anecdotes
